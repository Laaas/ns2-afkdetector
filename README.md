# About

This mod detects AFK players and kicks them if they are AFK for too long.

# Why not just use the shine AFK system?

The shine AFK system is buggy, does not correctly exclude spectators,
doesn't catch all signs of activity, is expensive for both server and client,
etc. etc.

This mod attempts to keep it simple, fast, and non-buggy.
This means no getting kicked when you're spectating, no getting kicked when you're
actually playing, and not having the performance of your server or client affected.
